### Code Requirements
The example code is in Java ([version 1.8](https://java.com/en/download/) or higher will work). 

### Description
The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet. 

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

```java

 E_{n}(x)=(x+n)\mod {26}.
 
 D_{n}(x)=(x-n)\mod {26}.
 
``` 

### Execution
To compile the code, simply run the `javac Caesar.java`.
To run the code, type `java Caesar`

```
javac Caesar.java
